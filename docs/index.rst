What Is Eero?
=============

Eero is a mesh Wi-Fi system designed to enhance wireless connectivity across larger areas by eliminating dead zones and signal drops. Unlike traditional routers, Eero units work together to form a cohesive network. These devices are small, sleek, and simple to install. Eero is ideal for households or small offices with multiple rooms, smart devices, and high-speed internet requirements.

Before You Begin
================

Before beginning your eero setup, ensure that you have the following:

- An active internet connection
- A modem (usually provided by your ISP)
- At least one eero device
- A smartphone with the eero app installed (available for Android and iOS)
- A power source for each eero device
- Ethernet cable (included with your Eero)

Initial Eero Setup
==================

The process of setting up your Eero network can be completed in a few simple steps. Follow this procedure carefully to ensure optimal performance.

Unboxing and Positioning
-------------------------

Unbox your eero devices and identify the main unit, which will connect directly to your modem. Place it in a central and open location. This will become the gateway for your mesh network. Additional eero units should be placed throughout the home or office, evenly spaced, and not too far from the main unit to ensure proper signal distribution.

Connecting the Gateway Eero
----------------------------

1. Disconnect your modem from any previously connected routers.
2. Power off the modem and plug in the eero gateway using the provided Ethernet cable.
3. Connect the modem to the eero’s WAN port.
4. Turn on both the modem and the eero gateway. Wait until the LED light starts flashing, indicating it’s ready for setup.

Using the Eero App
------------------

1. Open the eero app on your smartphone.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to begin the eero setup.
3. The app will detect your gateway and guide you through the naming of your network and setting a secure password.
4. Once the gateway is online, the app will prompt you to add additional eero devices.

Adding Additional Eero Devices
------------------------------

To ensure complete coverage, you may need to add more units. The app allows for easy integration:

1. Choose “Add eero” from the home screen.
2. Plug in your additional eero and wait for the blinking LED light.
3. The app will discover the device and confirm its location.
4. Repeat the process for other units in your setup.

Eero Setting Up Tips
====================

Here are several best practices for a successful eero setup:

Placement Matters
-----------------

- Avoid placing eero devices inside cabinets or behind furniture.
- Maintain line-of-sight where possible to reduce interference.
- Do not place near microwaves or cordless phones that might disrupt signals.

Name Your Network Clearly
--------------------------

Choose a recognizable name for your Wi-Fi network. Avoid special characters or names too similar to nearby networks to prevent confusion during the eero setting up phase.

Secure Your Network
-------------------

Use a strong, unique password. Eero supports WPA3 encryption for added security. Take advantage of features like guest networks to separate personal devices from guests or IoT hardware.

Firmware and Software Updates
-----------------------------

Eero regularly releases firmware updates that improve performance and add features. The app usually handles these updates automatically, but it’s good practice to check regularly.

Advanced Settings and Configuration
===================================

After completing your initial eero setup, the app provides several advanced configuration options to enhance and personalize your network.

Network Profiles
----------------

Create profiles for family members or devices to monitor usage or set parental controls. This is useful for scheduling downtime or managing screen time.

Device Prioritization
---------------------

You can prioritize specific devices during high-demand usage. For instance, prioritize your work laptop during Zoom meetings or streaming devices in the evening.

Static IP and DHCP Settings
---------------------------

Advanced users may want to assign static IPs or change DHCP settings for certain devices. These options are accessible in the app’s advanced menu and should only be adjusted if you understand networking principles.

Port Forwarding and UPnP
------------------------

Eero supports port forwarding for gaming or remote access to security systems. UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is also available and can be toggled for compatibility with certain devices.

Guest Networks
--------------

Enable guest access to provide internet to visitors without granting them access to your personal files and devices. This feature is simple to enable and can be managed independently from the main network.

Troubleshooting Common Issues
=============================

While the eero setup process is generally smooth, users might occasionally face minor issues. Here are some solutions to common problems.

No Internet Connection
----------------------

- Ensure the modem is functioning correctly.
- Reboot both the modem and the eero gateway.
- Check if the Ethernet cable is properly connected.

Device Not Found
----------------

- Make sure the device is plugged in and the LED is blinking.
- Restart the eero and try adding it again through the app.
- Verify your Bluetooth and location services are enabled on your smartphone.

Slow Network Speeds
-------------------

- Reposition eero units to ensure better signal flow.
- Check for firmware updates.
- Disconnect devices that are not in use.

Resetting Your Eero Network
===========================

If necessary, you can reset your eero network either via the app or by performing a physical reset.

Soft Reset
----------

This resets the device's network settings but preserves logs and some configurations.

1. Hold the reset button until the LED blinks yellow (about 7 seconds).
2. Release the button and allow the unit to reboot.

Hard Reset
----------

This will erase all settings and remove the device from your network.

1. Hold the reset button for 15 seconds until the LED turns red.
2. Release and allow the unit to restart as a new device.

When to Perform a Reset
-----------------------

- After changing your internet service provider
- If you’re moving to a new location
- When troubleshooting persistent connectivity issues

Expanding Your Network
======================

As your household grows or your workspace expands, adding new eero devices is easy and seamless.

Eero Beacons
------------

Beacons are smaller, plug-in versions of the main eero units. They’re ideal for hallways or bedrooms where power outlets are available but Ethernet ports aren’t.

Eero with Thread and Zigbee
---------------------------

Some eero models support smart home standards like Thread and Zigbee, enabling direct control of compatible smart devices without the need for separate hubs.

Eero Secure Subscription
=========================

Eero offers a subscription service called Eero Secure, which includes:

- Advanced threat protection
- Content filtering
- Ad blocking
- Usage insights

While not necessary for basic eero setup, this service adds additional layers of security and parental controls.

Conclusion
==========

Performing an eero setup is a streamlined process that brings powerful mesh networking capabilities into your home or office. With proper placement, a little planning, and the help of the eero app, users can eliminate dead zones and enjoy fast, reliable Wi-Fi across all devices. Whether you're new to networking or looking to upgrade your current system, setting up eero is a smart and future-proof investment. With features like parental controls, device prioritization, and easy scalability, Eero provides a comprehensive solution for today’s connected environments.
